# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

At [42 School](https://github.com/42School), almost every project must be written in accordance to the [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf), the school's coding standard. As a result, the implementation of certain parts may appear strange and for sure had room for improvement.
